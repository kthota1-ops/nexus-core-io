# SQL Injection: An Attacker's Entry Point

SQL Injection (SQLi) is a vulnerability where user input can manipulate queries sent to a database.

## The Vulnerable Code

Example vulnerable query:

\`\`\`sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' AND password = '1234';
\`\`\`

If the input is not sanitized, an attacker could enter:

\`\`\`
' OR '1'='1
\`\`\`

Which results in bypassing authentication.

## Mitigation Strategies

‚û°Ô∏è **Always use parameterized queries and ORM safeguards.**

### Secure Implementation:

\`\`\`python
# Good - Using parameterized queries
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = %s", (username,))
\`\`\`

### Additional Protection Layers:
- Input validation and sanitization
- Principle of least privilege for database users
- Web Application Firewalls (WAF)
- Regular security audits and penetration testing

## Conclusion

SQL Injection remains one of the most critical web vulnerabilities. Understanding attack vectors is the first step to building secure applications.

# Understanding Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

XSS attacks allow attackers to inject malicious JavaScript into trusted websites.

## Types of XSS

1. **Reflected XSS** - Immediate response from server
2. **Stored XSS** - Persisted in database
3. **DOM-based XSS** - Client-side manipulation

## Example Attack

\`\`\`javascript
<script>alert('XSS Vulnerability!')</script>
\`\`\`

## Prevention

- Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Input sanitization
- Output encoding
- HttpOnly cookies

# Automating Security Tasks with Python

Python is the go-to language for security automation and tooling.

## Building a Simple Port Scanner

\`\`\`python
import socket

def scan_port(host, port):
    sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    sock.settimeout(1)
    result = sock.connect_ex((host, port))
    sock.close()
    return result == 0
\`\`\`

## Popular Security Libraries

- **Scapy** - Packet manipulation
- **Requests** - HTTP testing
- **Paramiko** - SSH automation
- **Nmap** - Network scanning wrapper

# Building Secure CI/CD Pipelines

Security should be integrated at every stage of the DevOps lifecycle.

## DevSecOps Principles

1. Shift Left Security
2. Automated Security Testing
3. Continuous Monitoring
4. Infrastructure as Code Security

jobs:
  security:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Run Security Scan
